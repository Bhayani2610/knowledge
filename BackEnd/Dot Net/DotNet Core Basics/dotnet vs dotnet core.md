# **NET Core vs .NET Framework ‚Äì Detailed Description**

## üî∑**Difference between .Net Core and .Net Framework**
| Feature    | .NET Core | .NET Framework |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Platform | Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) | Windows-only |
| Performance | High performance and optimized for modern workloads | Moderate, older architecture not optimized for all scenarios |
| App Types | Web, console, microservices, cloud, APIs, gRPC, Blazor | Web (ASP.NET), desktop (WinForms, WPF), Windows services |
| Deployment | Flexible (self-contained or framework-dependent) | Web (ASP.NET), desktop (WinForms, WPF), Windows services |
| Modularity | Modular, NuGet-based packages | Monolithic and bulky |
| Open Source | Fully open-source (.NET Foundation) | Partially open source |
| CLI Support | Powerful CLI tools (dotnet) | Limited or complex command-line tooling |
| Latest Development | Actively developed (.NET 6/7/8 and beyond) | Legacy, only minor updates (latest is 4.8) |
| Microservices Support | Built with containers, Docker, and microservices in mind | Difficult to adapt for modern cloud-native scenarios |
| Cross-Compatibility | Works on ARM, Linux, macOS | Strictly x86/x64 on Windows |


## üî∑**Cross-platform capabilities**
* .NET Core was designed to be platform-independent, unlike the older .NET Framework which only runs on Windows
* With .NET Core develop and run apps on 
  * Windows
  * Linux
  * macOS
* Use the same codebase across all supported platforms
* Package and run your apps in Docker containers for maximum portability

## üî∑**CoreCLR AND CoreFX**
  ### **CoreCLR**
  * **Think of CoreCLR as :** `"The engine that runs your .NET Core application"`
  * CoreCLR is the runtime component of .NET Core. It's responsible for executing your application code
  * Key Responsibilities:
    * **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation** ‚Äì Converts IL (Intermediate Language) to native machine code at runtime.
    * **Memory management** ‚Äì Includes Garbage Collection (GC)
    * **Threading** ‚Äì Manages threads and task scheduling
    * **Exception handling** ‚Äì Handles runtime exceptions and errors
    * **Type safety and security** ‚Äì Enforces security boundaries, type verification

  ### **CoreFX**
  * **Think of CoreFX as:** `"The toolbox of commonly used types and libraries that your code uses"`
  * CoreFX is the base class library (BCL) for .NET Core. It's a set of reusable code that developers use to build applications
  * What‚Äôs in CoreFX
    * Collections (e.g., `List<T>`, `Dictionary<K,V>`)
    * File I/O
    * Networking (e.g., `HttpClient`)
    * JSON/XML serialization
    * LINQ
    * String manipulation
    * Data types, DateTime, Math, Regex, etc.

  ### **How They Work Together**
  ```
  Your Code (C#) 
      ‚¨áÔ∏è
  Compiler ‚Üí Intermediate Language (IL)
      ‚¨áÔ∏è
  CoreCLR ‚Üí Executes the IL
      ‚ÜïÔ∏è
  CoreFX ‚Üí Provides standard libraries used in your code
  ```

  ### _NOTE_
  *  üîÅ Evolution (as of .NET 5+ and .NET 6/7/8) With the release of .NET 5+, the .NET platform unified into a single runtime and library base:
  * CoreCLR + Mono runtimes merged into a unified .NET runtime.
  * CoreFX was folded into the .NET Base Class Library (BCL).

    | Component   | Role                            | Equivalent in .NET Framework           |
    | ----------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | **CoreCLR** | Runtime engine ‚Äì runs the app   | CLR (Common Language Runtime)          |
    | **CoreFX**  | Libraries ‚Äì what your code uses | .NET Framework Class Library (FCL/BCL) |
